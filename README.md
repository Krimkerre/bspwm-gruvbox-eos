testing ground for custom script in EndeavourOS installer <br>

These are mostly Sinomor's Void dots, modified for my own use. <br>
Couple of added features are a caps lock notifier, <br>
brigntness and volume notifications (courtesy of Nmoleo's script) <br>
and some minor tweaks here and there. <br><br>

all of this has been translated to work on EndeavourOS and systemd, with the ability to piggyback on EndeavourOS's calamares installer. <br> <br>

download folowing file and save it in the home folder of the live iso, overwriting the exisiting file
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Krimkerre/bspwm-gruvbox-eos/main/user_commands.bash

Change $USER inside the file to whatever username you have chosen.

proceed with 'online installer' and choose no DE.<br><br>

cava will have to be installed through AUR on first boot, login again and cava module should work in polybar

For the telegram theme:<br>
go to settings > chat settings and select 'choose from file'<br>
select the 'awesome.tdesktop-theme' file in the telegram folder under home.

<p>This is for testing only...<br>
Use at your own risk<br>
Do not expect this to work :)</p>
