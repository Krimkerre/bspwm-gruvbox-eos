download folowing file and save it in the home folder of the live iso, overwriting the exisiting file
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Krimkerre/bspwm-gruvbox-eos/main/user_commands.bash

Change $USER inside the file to whatever username you have chosen.

proceed with 'online installer' and choose no DE.<br><br>

cava will have to be installed through AUR on first boot, login again and cava module should work in polybar

For the telegram theme:<br>
go to settings > chat settings and select 'choose from file'<br>
select the 'awesome.tdesktop-theme' file in the telegram folder under home.
